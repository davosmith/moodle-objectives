Lesson objectives block
=======================

This is a block for Moodle 1.9. I am hoping to get it working with Moodle 2.0 in the next few days, but the current version will not work at all on a Moodle 2.0 site.

It displays current lesson objectives in the side bar (to both teacher and students) and allows a teacher to check them off as they are completed. You can enter a timetable, linked to different groups, so that objectives can be entered as far in advance as you want and will be displayed at the appropriate time.

Other features include:
* Abiliy to display a large version of the objectives, when teaching from the front of a class room (click on the 'expand' icon)
* Students can view all the objectives, a week at a time, to help keep track of what they have been doing (and will be doing)

==Installation==

1. If you haven't done so already, download the zip file from https://github.com/davosmith/moodle-objectives/zipball/master
2. Extract all the files to a suitable location
3. Create a folder on your server '<moodle root>/blocks/objectives'
4. Upload all the files in the 'davosmith-moodle-objectives-XXXXX' folder into this blocks/objectives folder on the server.
5. Log in as an administrator and click on the 'Notifications' link.
